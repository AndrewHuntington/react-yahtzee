# Reflection

# Additional Acknowledgements

This readme is based on a template called the [Peronsal project README template](https://gist.github.com/martensonbj/6bf2ec2ed55f5be723415ea73c4557c4) by GitHub user [martensonbj](https://gist.github.com/martensonbj).

This project is based on starter code provided by Colt Steele. The main objective of this project was to
take a project with a substantial amount of already written code and go through it, step-by-step,
and fix any bugs found/implement additional features to make a fully functional app.
Any code that was not already provided is my own.
